1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
    Boolean datatypes had 2 values- True and False
    use the bool() to test if value is True or False. False value are number zero and true values are number one.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
    AND,OR,NOT,NOR.NAND and XOR
    
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
    P 	Q	  AND(∧)  OR(∨) NAND(~∧)  NOR(~∨) XOR(⊻)  Conditional(⇒)  Bi-conditional(⇔)
    T 	T	    T	      T   	F	         F	     F	        T	              T
    T	  F	    F     	T	    T	         F       T	        F             	F
    F	  T   	F	      T   	T	         F	     T	        T	              F
    F	  F	    F	      F   	T	         T	     F	        T	              T
    
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 &gt; 4)
(5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
5. What are the six comparison operators?
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print(&#39;eggs&#39;)
if spam &gt; 5:
print(&#39;bacon&#39;)
else:
print(&#39;ham&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
