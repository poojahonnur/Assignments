1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
    Boolean datatypes had 2 values- True and False
    use the bool() to test if value is True or False. False value are number zero and true values are number one.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
    AND,OR,NOT,NOR.NAND and XOR
    
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
    P 	Q	  AND(∧)  OR(∨) NAND(~∧)  NOR(~∨) XOR(⊻)  Conditional(⇒)  Bi-conditional(⇔)
    T 	T	    T	    T   	F	         F	     F	        T	            T
    T	F	    F     	T	    T	         F       T	        F             	F
    F	T   	F	    T   	T	         F	     T	        T	            F
    F	F	    F	    F   	T	         T	     F	        T	            T
    
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)    -   1 and 0 = 0
not (5 > 4)             -   0
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)     -   1 or 0 = 1
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))   -   not(1 or 0) = not(1) = 0
(True and True) and (True == False)     -   1 and 0 = 0
(not False) or (not True)       -   1 or 0 = 1

5. What are the six comparison operators?
    >,<,==,!=,>=,<=
    
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
    = is an relational operator where == is an comparision operator
    = is used to assigning a value to a variable where == is used for comparing two variables.
   For example please refer below code to know when we use them.
    a=10 #assigning a value to a variable using assignment operator
    b=20 #assigning a value to a variable using assignment operator
    if a==b:  #comparing the value using equal to operator
        print("a is equal to b")
        else:
        print("a is not equal to b")
        
        
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
    spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')
        if spam > 5:
            print('bacon')
        else:
            print('ham')
            print('spam')
            print('spam')
    

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Spam=int(input("Enter a spam number"))
if(Spam==1):
    print("Hello")
elif(Spam==2):
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
    Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
    Break early terminates the loop where continue will cause execution of the next iteration
    Break stops the continuation of loop where continue does not stop the the continuation of loop just stops the current one.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
    In for loop range(10),range(0,10) and range(0,10,1) all defines the same range of values where, All od it gives an values ranging from index 0 to 9.
   
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
    For loop:
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(i)
    
    While loop:
    count=1
    while count<=10:
        print(count)
        count+=1
        
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
    spam.bacon()
